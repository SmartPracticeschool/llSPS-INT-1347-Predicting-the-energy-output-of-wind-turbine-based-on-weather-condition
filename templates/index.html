			  <h3>Wind Power Prediction : </h3>
			  <br>
			  <p>Wind energy is a significant and eligible source that has the potential for producing energy in a continuous and sustainable
			     manner among renewable energy sources. However, wind energy has several challenges, such as initial investment costs, the 
				 stationary property of wind plants, and the difficulty in finding wind-efficient energy areas. In this study, long-term wind
				 power forecasting was performed based on daily wind speed data using five machine learning algorithms. We proposed a method 
				 based on machine learning algorithms to forecast wind power values efficiently. We conducted several case studies to reveal 
				 performances of machine learning algorithms. The results showed that machine learning algorithms could be used for 
				 forecasting long-term wind power values with respect to historical wind speed data. Furthermore, the results showed 
				 that machine learning-based models could be applied to a location different from model-trained locations. This study 
				 demonstrated that machine learning algorithms could be successfully used before the establishment of wind plants in 
				 an unknown geographical location whether it is logical by using the model of a base location.</p>
